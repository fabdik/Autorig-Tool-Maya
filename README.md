Creating HumanIK Rig:
Before running the script, you need to create a HumanIK rig in Maya. 

Running the Script:

Locators Creation: The script generates locators at the positions of the joints in your HumanIK rig. Locators are lightweight and easy to move, making it simpler to adjust the rig. Any form or shape can be done using the locators
Hierarchical Rig Setup: The script organizes these locators into a hierarchy that mirrors the structure of the joints. This hierarchy helps in maintaining the relationships between different parts of the rig.

Purpose:
The script simplifies the rigging process by using locators instead of joints for adjustments. This approach makes it easier to work with and adjust the rig, as locators are less complex and more manageable compared to joints.
